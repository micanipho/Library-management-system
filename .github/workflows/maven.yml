name: Java CI with Mavenaven.yml` file.
2. Update the `setup-java` step to use a supported Java version, such as Java 17.

Here is an example of how you can update the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Java CI with Maven

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:


    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses:        java-version: [17, 21] # Add the JDK versions you want to test

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: '17'

   
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean install
 up JDK ${{ matrix.java-version }}
      uses:```

This ensures that the workflow uses Java 17, which is supported by the Maven compiler plugin. actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: ${{ matrix.java-version }}
